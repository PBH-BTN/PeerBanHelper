This increases the load on the tracker server and may lead to your IP address being banned by the tracker. We encourage you to migrate to other downloaders whenever possible. https://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper/issues/382"

LAB_EXPERIMENT_IPFS_TITLE: "IPFS Decentralized Network"
LAB_EXPERIMENT_IPFS_DESCRIPTION: |
  [IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)](https://ipfs.tech/) is a decentralized, distributed network without central servers, where every computer acts as a node in the IPFS network.  
  IPFS is flexible and resilient, allowing you to store and retrieve files, as well as transfer data or resources. As resources become increasingly popular, their speed and accessibility automatically improve. Conversely, when data is no longer needed by any node (and is not intentionally retained), it will gradually be removed from the network over time.  
  Without requiring a server, you can also share your own ban lists or IP rules with others.  
  
  To use IPFS features, enable this experiment and configure the RPC address for the Kubo IPFS client in the configuration. Once enabled, you will be able to subscribe to IP-based rules shared with you via IPFS/IPNS.
IPFS_INIT_FAILED: "[IPFS] Initializing Kubo IPFS RPC fails, IPFS functionality will not be available, make sure Kubo IPFS is running, you can ignore this warning if you don't use IPFS related functions: {}"

DOWNLOADER_DOCKER_INCORRECT_NETWORK_DETECTED_TITLE: "Critical Error: Downloader in Incorrect Network Mode, PeerBanHelper May Not Work"
DOWNLOADER_DOCKER_INCORRECT_NETWORK_DETECTED_DESCRIPTION: |
  Critical error detected: The Peer inbound connection IP address configuration of the downloader {} is incorrect ({}).  
  PeerBanHelper requires the real IP address of the Peer to function correctly, otherwise, it will incorrectly ban all inbound connections. Therefore, PeerBanHelper is ignoring these abnormal addresses. Bans will not take effect.  
  This is usually caused by the downloader running in a Docker environment and using the `bridge` network mode. You must switch to the `host` network mode to avoid user-space forwarding rewriting the IP address information.  
  
  Note: You should correctly fix the IP issue. Simply removing internal network IP addresses from the ignore list will cause PeerBanHelper to incorrectly ban all inbound connections.  
  For assistance, please join the PeerBanHelper community. **This prompt will only appear once per downloader.**
